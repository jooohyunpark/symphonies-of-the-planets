```
Duration – distance from Earth [pc
: Earth(0) doesn't play and the furthest plays a full cycle.
 
Cycle duration – orbit period [days] 
: Earth(365) takes 60 minutes to complete a cycle.

Pitch – planet radius [Jupiter radii]
: Earth(0.0892) is C4. The bigger, the lower, and vice versa. Each side has a different mapping scale.
